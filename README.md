# Seed Project: React Typescript Redux

## Overview

This branch creates a sample React Typescript app that uses Redux.

The app is a sub-folder of this project, since I think it is preferable to re-run `create-react-app`
for every project, instead of cloning this repo. Nevertheless, it should serve as a guide for how to wire
React and Redux together.

This project was created by following the tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93p3LxR9xfM&t=683s)
and adding Typescript annotations where appropriate.


## Steps to reproduce

1. Create react app
```
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app sample-app --scripts-version=react-scripts-ts
```

2. Modify components as desired (use the components in the sample app as a guide)
