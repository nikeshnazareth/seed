# Seed Project: React Typescript

## Overview

This branch creates contains example React Components with Typescript annotations.

It does not have a sample project since `create-react-app` already produces a working app
with serve, build and test scripts.

## Usage

1. Run `create-react-app [project name] --scripts-version=react-scripts-ts`
1. Use the components in `./example-components` as a guide for type annotations on React components
