# Seed Project

## Overview

This is a simply the seed Angular project that comes with the angular CLI.

## Usage

Run `initialise.sh`. 

This will request a prefix and create the project in a new directory `<prefix>-app`.

I expect that nobody will use this version of the repository directly 
(you could just run the Angular CLI initialisation)

Instead, this branch will be merged with branches corresponding to other technologies 
in order to produce an integrated seed project.
